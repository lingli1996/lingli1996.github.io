Hi there! This is Ling Li. I currently serve as a research assistant at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou). I am fortunately supervised by Professor [Wei Zeng](https://zeng-wei.com/) at [HKUST-CIVAL](https://hkust-cival.com). My primary research interests lie in the exploration and development of Generative AI.

Prior to joining HKUST-CIVAL group, I gained impressive industry experience through full-time and internship roles at Tencent, Baidu, and start-up. My academic background includes a Master of Engineering degree, specialized in Software Engineering, from Xi'an Jiaotong University, and a Bachelor of Science degree, with a concentration in Management Information System, from Anhui University.

If you are interested in my research, please feel free to contact me!
